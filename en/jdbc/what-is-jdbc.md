# What is JDBC?

JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. Imagine you have a big library with lots of books (a database), and you want to find a specific book or add a new one. JDBC is like a special language that helps your Java program talk to this library (database).

With JDBC, your Java program can:

1. **Connect to the Database**: Just like getting a library card to enter the library, JDBC helps your program connect to the database.

2. **Send Queries**: Once inside, your program can ask the database questions like, "Do you have this book?" or "Can you give me all the books published after 2020?" These questions are written in a language called SQL (Structured Query Language), and JDBC helps your program send these questions to the database.

3. **Get Results**: After asking a question, the database sends back the answers. JDBC helps your program understand and process these answers.

So, in simple terms, JDBC is like a bridge that allows your Java program to communicate with a database, enabling it to ask questions, get answers, and work with the data inside.
