# Configure JDBC for SQLite

After successfully adding the SQLite JDBC driver dependency to your project, you need to configure the connection to SQLite. Follow these steps to configure SQLite in your Java project:

1. **Obtain SQLite Database File Path**: SQLite databases are typically stored as files on your local filesystem. Obtain the path to your SQLite database file.

2. **Configure JDBC Connection**: Use the obtained database file path to configure your JDBC connection in your Java code. Here's an example of how you can configure the JDBC connection using the SQLite JDBC driver:

   ```java
   import java.sql.Connection;
   import java.sql.DriverManager;
   import java.sql.SQLException;

   public class SQLiteConnection {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // SQLite database file path
           String databasePath = "jdbc:sqlite:/path/to/your/database.db";

           // Establish JDBC connection
           try {
               Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(databasePath);

               // Connection established successfully
               System.out.println("Connected to SQLite!");

               // Use the connection for executing queries or other database operations
               // ...

               // Don't forget to close the connection when done
               connection.close();
           } catch (SQLException e) {
               // Handle connection errors
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace `"/path/to/your/database.db"` with the actual path to your SQLite database file.

3. **Test the Connection**: After configuring the connection, run your Java application to test if the connection to SQLite is established successfully. Ensure that you can execute queries or perform other database operations as needed.

By following these steps, you can configure JDBC for SQLite in your Java project and establish a connection to your SQLite database.
