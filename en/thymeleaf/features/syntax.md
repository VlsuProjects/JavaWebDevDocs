# Thymeleaf Syntax

To understand the following information, it is recommended to already understand what a Thymeleaf template is and how to use it. If you are not familiar with it, it is recommended to read about [Thymeleaf templates](thymeleaf-templates.md).

Thymeleaf syntax constructs are used to embed dynamic content into HTML templates. They are often written in HTML tag attributes and allow you to interact with data passed from the controller to the page.

Thymeleaf expressions typically start with the `th:` prefix. For example, `th:text`, `th:if`, `th:each`, etc.

Main Thymeleaf constructs include:
- `th:text` - sets the text content of a tag [Text in Thymeleaf][thymeleaf-text]
- Variables - inserting variables into text [Variables in Thymeleaf][thymeleaf-variables]
- `th:if` - conditional operator [Conditional Operator in Thymeleaf][thymeleaf-if]
- `th:each` - loop [Loops in Thymeleaf][thymeleaf-each]
- Arrays and Lists [Arrays and Lists in Thymeleaf][thymeleaf-arrays]
- Template Layout [Blocks in Thymeleaf][thymeleaf-code-blocks]
- Links and URLs [Links and URLs in Thymeleaf][thymeleaf-links]
- Thymeleaf Standard Expressions [Thymeleaf Standard Expressions][thymeleaf-standard-expressions]
- Messages from Localization File [Messages from Localization File in Thymeleaf][thymeleaf-messages]
- Forms - form handling [Forms in Thymeleaf][thymeleaf-forms]
- Data Formatting [Formatting][thymeleaf-formatting]
