# Setup Thymeleaf Security

Thymeleaf is a popular template engine for server-side rendering in Spring Boot applications. When integrating Thymeleaf with Spring Security, you can control access to your web pages based on user roles and authorities. This document will guide you through the process of configuring Thymeleaf security with Spring, ensuring seamless integration between your application's views and security settings.

## Compatibility
Ensure that you are using the compatible versions of Thymeleaf and Spring Security for seamless integration:
- Thymeleaf version 3.x or higher
- Spring Security version 5.x or higher

## Steps

### Step 1: Add Thymeleaf Spring Security Dependency
First, you need to include the Thymeleaf Spring Security integration library in your project's dependencies. This library provides Thymeleaf dialects for handling security-related expressions.

For Gradle Groovy, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy
implementation 'org.thymeleaf.extras:thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity6'
```

For Maven, add this dependency to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.thymeleaf.extras</groupId>
    <artifactId>thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity6</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.4.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

Replace the version number with the latest compatible version available.

### Step 2: Configure Thymeleaf Security Dialect
Next, you need to configure Thymeleaf to use the Spring Security dialect. This dialect enables you to include security-related expressions directly in your Thymeleaf templates.

In your Spring Boot application configuration class, typically annotated with `@Configuration`, register the Thymeleaf Security dialect:
```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.thymeleaf.extras.springsecurity6.dialect.SpringSecurityDialect;

@Configuration
public class ThymeleafSecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public SpringSecurityDialect springSecurityDialect() {
        return new SpringSecurityDialect();
    }
}
```

This bean ensures that Spring Security expressions are processed correctly in your Thymeleaf templates.


## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully configured Thymeleaf security with Spring in your Spring Boot application. By integrating Spring Security expressions into your Thymeleaf templates, you can easily control access to different parts of your application based on user authentication and authorization. Thymeleaf's seamless integration with Spring Security provides a powerful mechanism for building secure web applications.

**Remember to always use compatible versions of Thymeleaf and Spring Security to ensure smooth integration and avoid compatibility issues.**
