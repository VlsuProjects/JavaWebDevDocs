# **Introduction to Transactions**

## **What are transactions?**
Transactions are units of work performed within a database management system (DBMS) that must be executed as a whole. They represent a sequence of database operations (such as reads, writes, updates, and deletes) that are treated as a single logical unit. Transactions ensure data integrity by either completing all of their operations successfully (committing) or reverting any changes made if an error occurs (rolling back).

## **Why are transactions important in databases?**
Transactions are crucial in databases because they ensure data consistency and integrity, even in the presence of concurrent access and system failures. By grouping database operations into transactions, it's possible to maintain the ACID properties, which guarantee that transactions are executed reliably and predictably.

## **ACID properties of transactions**
ACID is an acronym that stands for:
  - **Atomicity**: Transactions are atomic, meaning that either all of their operations are completed successfully, or none of them are. There are no partial or intermediate states.
  - **Consistency**: Transactions maintain the consistency of the database by transforming it from one valid state to another valid state. Constraints, such as foreign key constraints and uniqueness constraints, are enforced during transactions.
  - **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from each other to prevent interference or inconsistency caused by concurrent transactions. Isolation ensures that each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database.
  - **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive system failures. Durability is achieved through mechanisms like transaction logs and database backups.

## **Transaction Isolation Levels**

### **Read Uncommitted**
In the Read Uncommitted isolation level, transactions can read data that has been modified by other transactions but not yet committed. This level offers the lowest level of isolation and can lead to phenomena such as dirty reads.

### **Read Committed**
In the Read Committed isolation level, transactions can only read data that has been committed by other transactions. This level prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.

### **Repeatable Read**
In the Repeatable Read isolation level, transactions maintain a consistent view of the data throughout their execution. This level prevents non-repeatable reads but allows phantom reads, where new rows matching the search conditions may appear during the transaction.

### **Serializable**
In the Serializable isolation level, transactions are executed as if they were the only transactions running on the database. This level provides the highest level of isolation, preventing dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

### **Choosing the appropriate isolation level**
The choice of isolation level depends on the specific requirements of the application and the trade-offs between consistency and concurrency. It's essential to consider factors such as data access patterns, transaction throughput, and the risk of concurrency-related anomalies when selecting the appropriate isolation level.

## **Transaction Management**

### **Beginning and ending transactions**
Transactions begin with the execution of a transaction-start command (e.g., BEGIN TRANSACTION) and end with either a commit or rollback operation. Beginning a transaction marks the start of a logical unit of work, while ending a transaction either confirms or discards the changes made during the transaction.

### **Committing and rolling back transactions**
Committing a transaction applies all of its changes to the database, making them permanent. Rolling back a transaction undoes all of its changes, restoring the database to its state before the transaction began. Commit and rollback operations are crucial for maintaining data consistency and integrity.

### **Savepoints**
Savepoints allow transactions to be divided into smaller units of work, enabling partial rollback and recovery. By setting savepoints within a transaction, it's possible to roll back to a specific point in the transaction without undoing all of its changes. Savepoints provide flexibility and granularity in transaction management.

## **Transaction Logs**

### **Importance of transaction logs**
Transaction logs record all changes made to the database during transactions, providing a durable record of transactional activity. Transaction logs are essential for ensuring durability, enabling recovery from system failures, and supporting features such as point-in-time recovery and replication.

### **Redo and undo operations**
Redo and undo operations are used during transaction recovery to bring the database back to a consistent state after a failure. Redo operations reapply committed transactions from the transaction log to recreate changes made since the last checkpoint, while undo operations roll back uncommitted transactions to discard their changes.
