# Setting Up Spring Security in Your Project

Incorporating Spring Security into your project is a crucial step in fortifying its defenses against security threats and vulnerabilities. Whether you're using Maven or Gradle as your build tool, integrating Spring Security is straightforward. Let's explore how to set up Spring Security in your project, along with considerations for compatibility with your Spring or Spring Boot version.

## Setup with Maven

### Step 1: Add Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### Step 2: Update Maven Project

After adding the dependency to your `pom.xml` file, update your Maven project to download the necessary dependencies.

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Setup with Gradle

### Step 1: Add Dependency

```groovy
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'
```

### Step 2: Sync Gradle Project

After adding the dependency to your `build.gradle` file, sync your Gradle project to download the necessary dependencies.

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Compatibility Notice

When selecting the version of Spring Security to use, ensure compatibility with your Spring or Spring Boot version to avoid any compatibility issues or unexpected behavior. Refer to the official documentation or release notes for compatibility guidelines and recommendations.

For example, if you're using Spring Boot version `2.5.x`, you may want to use Spring Security version `5.5.x` to ensure seamless integration and compatibility with the latest features and improvements.
