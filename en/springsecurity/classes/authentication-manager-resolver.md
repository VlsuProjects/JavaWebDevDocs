# AuthenticationManagerResolver in Spring Security

In Spring Security, `AuthenticationManagerResolver` is a versatile interface introduced in Spring Security 5.5. It enables developers to dynamically resolve an `AuthenticationManager` based on the context of an authentication request. This dynamic resolution capability is particularly valuable in scenarios where different authentication managers are needed based on contextual factors, such as multi-tenancy or varying authentication requirements.

## Mission of AuthenticationManagerResolver

The primary mission of `AuthenticationManagerResolver` is to dynamically determine the appropriate `AuthenticationManager` instance to handle an authentication request. It empowers developers to programmatically select the most suitable `AuthenticationManager` based on contextual information, allowing for greater flexibility and customization in authentication processing.

## Example Usage

### Implementing Custom AuthenticationManagerResolver

Developers can craft custom implementations of `AuthenticationManagerResolver` to dynamically choose the appropriate `AuthenticationManager` for different authentication scenarios.

### Example:

```java
public class CustomAuthenticationManagerResolver implements AuthenticationManagerResolver<HttpServletRequest> {

    @Autowired
    private AuthenticationManager primaryAuthenticationManager;

    @Autowired
    private AuthenticationManager secondaryAuthenticationManager;

    @Override
    public AuthenticationManager resolve(HttpServletRequest request) {
        // Custom logic to determine which AuthenticationManager to use based on request context
        if (/* condition */) {
            return primaryAuthenticationManager;
        } else {
            return secondaryAuthenticationManager;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `CustomAuthenticationManagerResolver` implements the `AuthenticationManagerResolver` interface and dynamically selects the appropriate `AuthenticationManager` based on the request context.

### Configuring AuthenticationManagerResolver

To leverage `AuthenticationManagerResolver`, configure it within the Spring Security setup to handle the resolution of `AuthenticationManager` instances for authentication requests.

### Example:

```java
@Autowired
private CustomAuthenticationManagerResolver authenticationManagerResolver;

@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authenticationManagerResolver(authenticationManagerResolver)
        // Other security configurations...
}
```

Here, `CustomAuthenticationManagerResolver` is injected into the Spring Security configuration and designated as the resolver responsible for determining the `AuthenticationManager` to handle authentication requests.

## Conclusion

`AuthenticationManagerResolver` equips developers with a potent tool for dynamically resolving the appropriate `AuthenticationManager` based on contextual information. By implementing custom `AuthenticationManagerResolver` implementations, developers can tackle complex authentication scenarios effectively and tailor authentication handling to meet the specific requirements of their applications.
