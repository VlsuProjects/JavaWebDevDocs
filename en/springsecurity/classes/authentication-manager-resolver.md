# AuthenticationManagerResolver in Spring Security

In Spring Security, `AuthenticationManagerResolver` is an interface introduced in Spring Security 5.5. It provides a mechanism to dynamically resolve an `AuthenticationManager` based on the context of an authentication request. This allows developers to programmatically determine which `AuthenticationManager` should handle a particular authentication attempt, providing more flexibility in multi-tenant or complex authentication scenarios.

## Mission of AuthenticationManagerResolver

The primary mission of `AuthenticationManagerResolver` is to resolve an appropriate `AuthenticationManager` for processing an authentication request based on contextual information. It enables developers to implement custom logic to select the most suitable `AuthenticationManager` instance dynamically.

## Example Usage

### Implementing Custom AuthenticationManagerResolver

Developers can create custom implementations of `AuthenticationManagerResolver` to dynamically determine the `AuthenticationManager` for handling authentication requests.

### Example:

```java
public class CustomAuthenticationManagerResolver implements AuthenticationManagerResolver<HttpServletRequest> {

    @Autowired
    private AuthenticationManager primaryAuthenticationManager;

    @Autowired
    private AuthenticationManager secondaryAuthenticationManager;

    @Override
    public AuthenticationManager resolve(HttpServletRequest request) {
        // Custom logic to determine which AuthenticationManager to use based on request context
        if (/* condition */) {
            return primaryAuthenticationManager;
        } else {
            return secondaryAuthenticationManager;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `CustomAuthenticationManagerResolver` implements the `AuthenticationManagerResolver` interface and overrides the `resolve` method to dynamically select the appropriate `AuthenticationManager` based on the request context.

### Configuring AuthenticationManagerResolver

To use `AuthenticationManagerResolver`, configure it in the Spring Security configuration to be invoked when resolving the `AuthenticationManager` for authentication requests.

### Example:

```java
@Autowired
private CustomAuthenticationManagerResolver authenticationManagerResolver;

@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authenticationManagerResolver(authenticationManagerResolver)
        // Other security configurations...
}
```

In this example, `CustomAuthenticationManagerResolver` is injected into the Spring Security configuration and configured as the resolver for determining the `AuthenticationManager` for authentication requests.

## Conclusion

`AuthenticationManagerResolver` provides developers with a powerful mechanism to dynamically resolve the appropriate `AuthenticationManager` for processing authentication requests based on contextual information. By implementing custom `AuthenticationManagerResolver` implementations, developers can address complex authentication scenarios and achieve greater flexibility in handling authentication within their applications.
