# AuthenticationManager in Spring Security

In Spring Security, `AuthenticationManager` is a core interface responsible for authenticating users during the authentication process. It acts as a central manager for processing authentication requests and delegating authentication to registered `AuthenticationProvider` instances.

## Mission of AuthenticationManager

The primary mission of `AuthenticationManager` is to authenticate users based on the provided credentials. It orchestrates the authentication process by invoking registered `AuthenticationProvider` instances to validate user identities and credentials. Additionally, it handles the management of authentication-related exceptions and determines the authentication success or failure.

## Example Usage

### Configuration

To use `AuthenticationManager`, it needs to be configured in the Spring Security configuration along with one or more `AuthenticationProvider` instances.

### Example:

```java
@Autowired
private DaoAuthenticationProvider authenticationProvider;

@Bean
public AuthenticationManager authenticationManager() {
    return new ProviderManager(Collections.singletonList(authenticationProvider));
}
```

In this example, `AuthenticationManager` is configured with a single `DaoAuthenticationProvider` instance. Additional `AuthenticationProvider` instances can be added to support different authentication mechanisms.

### Authentication

When authenticating users, `AuthenticationManager` is invoked by Spring Security to process authentication requests.

### Example:

```java
@Autowired
private AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;

public void authenticateUser(String username, String password) {
    Authentication authentication = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password);
    Authentication authenticated = authenticationManager.authenticate(authentication);
    SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authenticated);
}
```

In this example, the `authenticate` method of `AuthenticationManager` is called to authenticate the user using the provided username and password. The resulting `Authentication` object contains the authenticated user details.

## Conclusion

`AuthenticationManager` plays a crucial role in the authentication process within Spring Security-enabled applications. By configuring and using `AuthenticationManager` with appropriate `AuthenticationProvider` instances, developers can implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities and ensure secure access to protected resources.
