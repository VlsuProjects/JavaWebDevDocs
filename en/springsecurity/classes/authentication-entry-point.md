# AuthenticationEntryPoint in Spring Security

In Spring Security, `AuthenticationEntryPoint` is an interface responsible for initiating the authentication process when an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected resource. It handles unauthorized access attempts by redirecting users to the login page, displaying a custom error message, or sending a specific HTTP response code.

## Mission of AuthenticationEntryPoint

The primary mission of `AuthenticationEntryPoint` is to provide a mechanism for initiating the authentication process for unauthenticated users accessing protected resources. It allows developers to define custom behavior for handling unauthorized access attempts, such as redirecting users to a login page, displaying an error message, or sending a specific HTTP response code.

## Example Usage

### Implementing Custom AuthenticationEntryPoint

Developers can create custom implementations of `AuthenticationEntryPoint` to define behavior for handling unauthorized access attempts.

### Example:

```java
@Component
public class CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint implements AuthenticationEntryPoint {

    @Override
    public void commence(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, AuthenticationException authException) throws IOException, ServletException {
        // Custom logic to handle unauthorized access attempts
        response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED, "Unauthorized: " + authException.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this example, `CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint` implements the `AuthenticationEntryPoint` interface and overrides the `commence` method to send a custom error message in the HTTP response for unauthorized access attempts.

### Configuring AuthenticationEntryPoint

To use `AuthenticationEntryPoint`, configure it in the Spring Security configuration to be invoked when unauthorized access attempts occur.

### Example:

```java
@Autowired
private CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint authenticationEntryPoint;

@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .exceptionHandling()
            .authenticationEntryPoint(authenticationEntryPoint)
            // Other exception handling configurations...
}
```

In this example, `CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint` is injected into the Spring Security configuration and configured as the authentication entry point for handling unauthorized access attempts.

## Conclusion

`AuthenticationEntryPoint` provides developers with a flexible mechanism to define custom behavior for handling unauthorized access attempts in Spring Security-enabled applications. By implementing custom `AuthenticationEntryPoint` implementations or using built-in ones provided by Spring Security, developers can tailor the handling of unauthorized access to meet the specific requirements of their applications.
