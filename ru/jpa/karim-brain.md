# Explanation for what is inside my brain
- in this folder we explains everything in code way. every file here should speaks about the jpa code and implementation of the title. or how to achieve it or how to do it. it's all for implementation. you can take a look at `Securirty` and `Spring Security` idea. I made them as designed in my brain and also as I saw in different internet libraries. good luck repyata.
