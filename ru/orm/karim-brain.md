# Explanation for what is inside my brain
- in this folder we explains everything in theory way. not for specific library. in the library folder we explains everything from code vision. `Securirty` and `Spring Security` idea. I made them as designed in my brain and also as I saw in different internet libraries. good luck repyata.
- listen, in those files we explain how orm achieve those titles. also we explain the titles again. for example we will speak about procedure, we will explain what is procedure and how it was in the regular way in databases syntax for example, then how orm solved that. u can say that it uses code for bla bla.
- if needed to use a code example to explain some ideas, u can use jpa to achieve the idea. but you have to mention that you are going to jpa as an example. it's just of needed. try your best to make everything just theories.
- add diagrams, archetectures. pictures that explains logic.. search in google for that.

### Basic Operations:
1. **Mapping Objects to Tables**
    - Automatically maps classes and their properties to corresponding database tables and columns.
    - Handles data type conversions between object-oriented representations and database types.

2. **CRUD Operations**
    - Provides methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database.
    - Abstracts away SQL queries, allowing developers to perform these operations using object-oriented syntax.
    - Includes support for executing custom SQL queries when necessary.

3. **Relationship Management**
    - Handles relationships between entities in the code and tables in the database, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
    - Simplifies navigation between related objects and ensures data consistency across related entities.

### Interaction:
1. **Database Abstraction**
    - Offers a layer of abstraction over the database, allowing developers to interact with it using object-oriented constructs.
    - Shields developers from the complexities of writing raw SQL queries.

2. **Transaction Management**
    - Supports atomic transactions, ensuring that a group of database operations either succeeds or fails as a single unit.
    - Provides mechanisms for committing or rolling back transactions based on success or failure.

3. **Optimized Queries**
    - Automatically generates efficient SQL queries based on the developer's object-oriented code and database schema.
    - Helps improve performance by minimizing the number of database queries and optimizing query execution.
    - Allows for the execution of custom SQL queries, including complex joins and aggregations.

4. **Database Independence**
    - Allows developers to write code that works with multiple database management systems without significant modifications.
    - Provides a level of abstraction that shields the application from vendor-specific SQL syntax and features.

### Development:
1. **Migration**
    - Automatically generates database schemas based on object-oriented code, reducing the need for manual schema management.
    - Offers migration tools for updating the database schema as the code evolves over time.

2. **Validation and Constraints**
   - Allows developers to define validation rules and constraints at the object level, ensuring data integrity within the application.
   - Validates data before it is persisted to the database, reducing the risk of invalid or inconsistent data.


###  Objects:
1. **Queries**
   - Allows developers to execute custom SQL queries directly through the ORM framework.
   - Provides flexibility for handling complex database operations not covered by standard CRUD methods.

2. **Views**
   - Supports the creation, management, and utilization of database views within the application.
   - Enables developers to abstract and simplify complex queries by encapsulating them into views.

3. **Triggers**
   - Offers mechanisms for defining and managing database triggers that automatically execute in response to specified database events.
   - Enhances data integrity and consistency by enforcing business rules and constraints at the database level.

4. **Procedures**
   - Facilitates the execution of stored procedures defined within the database directly from the application code.
   - Enables encapsulation of business logic and complex operations within the database for improved performance and security.

5. **Functions**
   - Supports the utilization of database functions, such as scalar functions, table-valued functions, and aggregate functions, within the application.
   - Allows developers to leverage database functions for data manipulation and computation directly from the object-oriented code.
